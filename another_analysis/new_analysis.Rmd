Some data was formatted in Excel. Personal Identifiers were removed.

Standardizing first names

```{r standardizes first names}

  mutate(first_name_lower = str_to_title(`Owner First Name`))


```


Chart with Average Points For and Points Against

```{r Avg Points For and Against}
# Create the summary table

  group_by(first_name_lower) %>%

# Rename columns for readability

Add a column to main dataset to indicate winner for ease of graphing

```{r Add a column for the winner each season}

teams1_info_2023_thru_2014_updated <- 
  teams1_info_2023_thru_2014_updated %>%
  mutate(winner_y_n = ifelse(`Final Rank` == 1, "yes", "no"))


```

Graph of Points For and Against per season. Removed player who only played a single season

```{r plots for points for and against}
